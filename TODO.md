# Mobile Ball Animation Fixes

## Current Issues
- Ball animations not loading on mobile view
- WebGL performance constraints on mobile devices
- High DPR causing memory issues
- Multiple canvases overloading mobile resources

## Tasks
- [ ] Update Ball.jsx with mobile detection and optimizations
- [ ] Reduce DPR for mobile devices
- [ ] Optimize Float animation parameters for mobile
- [ ] Add better WebGL error handling
- [ ] Test mobile view without affecting desktop
- [ ] Verify all balls load properly on mobile

## Implementation Plan
1. Add mobile detection utility
2. Conditionally apply mobile optimizations
3. Maintain desktop performance and appearance
4. Test across different mobile devices/screen sizes
